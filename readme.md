# Challenge from BEYONDCSS

I make the challenge at the start and later on make some changes to it from the videos.

## Main difference between the original

I didn't use a a inverted class instead i use the data- attribute with value inverted.

It's a new way i'm trying before this i use BEM.

Example

```

.button--inverted {
  color: white
}

```

Now i discarded the M of BEM and use data- attribute instead.

Example

```

button[data-set="inverted"] {
 color: white
}

```

## Another Changes

I make the card responsive and use grid and not flex for this one.
